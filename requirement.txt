I think this is a good start

We would need to break it down by category for example

Dashboards for Sales Representatives

would have indented 5 sub links

Sales Overview Home (Embedded)
Accounts
Sales Rep Overview
Trending
Whitespace (individual)

Dashboards for Sales Executives would have 3 sublinks

Executive Overview – Pipeline Performance
Executive Overview – Sales Performance
Executive Overview – Service Performance

Dashboards for Sales Operations would have 5 sublinks

Company Overview
Company Trending
Lead Analysis
Sales Performance (Operations)
Sales Stage Analysis

And then we can list in Others the rest such as 1) Sales Analytics Home Dashboard 2) Sales Analytics Account Dashboard (Embedded) and so on

Maybe you can just do one for example you could do the

General Purpose and Embedded Dashboards
Sales Analytics Home
Account (Embedded)
Opportunity (Embedded)
Sales Overview Home (Embedded)
Dashboards for Sales Managers
Forecast
Leaderboard
Team Activities
Team Benchmark
Team Trending
Team Whitespace
